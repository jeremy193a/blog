Welcome to my new blog! This site is built with Astro, focusing on three core principles:

## Lightning Fast Performance

This blog is built with performance in mind. No unnecessary JavaScript, no heavy frameworks, just pure static HTML that loads instantly.

## SEO-First Approach

Every page is optimized for search engines with:
- Semantic HTML structure
- Proper meta tags and Open Graph data
- JSON-LD structured data
- Clean, crawlable URLs

## Minimal Dependencies

We keep things simple. The entire site uses:
- Astro for static site generation
- Plain CSS for styling
- Markdown for content

No bloat, no complexity, just a fast, accessible blog that works everywhere.

## What's Next?

Stay tuned for more posts about web development, performance optimization, and building for the modern web.
